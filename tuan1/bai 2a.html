    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
    <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant<br>
        of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler<br>
        was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and<br> 
        astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well<br>
        over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical<br>
        outline of the main physical theories of the time.<br></p>
    <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps<br>
       best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula
    </p>
    <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e (ix)</p>
    <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From<br> this equation, it's easy to derive the equation</p>
    <p>e(pi i) + 1 = 0</p>
    <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, pi, e, and i in a single beautiful and<br> elegant statement.</p>
    <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly<br> unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
